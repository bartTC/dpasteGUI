I've written this app on day 3 in my Objective-C/Cocoa adventure. I'm usually a
webdeveloper and there are some things I've never dealed with, such as memory
allocation/delocation. So, if you have *any* hints or notices for me, please
drop me an email: martin@mahner.org

This app uses an external library ASIHTTPRequest_ so I don't need to hassle
with the REST stuff.
